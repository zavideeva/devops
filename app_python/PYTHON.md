# DevOps lab 1-2
## Lab 1
I developed a Python web application, that shows current time in Moscow (the code you can see in file main.py).

The best practices that I used:  
1. Flask - web development application.
2. Gunicorn - a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, that is used for my app on production stage.
3. .gitignore file
4. requirements.txt file to provide all dependences that are used
5. Using popular linter pylint (got score 10/10)
6. Using Docker containers to containerize app
